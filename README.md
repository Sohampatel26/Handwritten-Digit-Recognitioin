# Handwritten-Digit-Recognitioin
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). This has been a topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning.
We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.
